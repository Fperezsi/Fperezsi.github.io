This talk primarily focused on techniques to demonstrate existence of solutions for nonlinear partial differential equations. Minimax theorems, such as the Mountain Pass Theorem and the Linking Theorem, were introduced. I also covered essential background techniques, including the Nemytskii Operator and the Deformation Lemma. The duration of my presentation was two months.
