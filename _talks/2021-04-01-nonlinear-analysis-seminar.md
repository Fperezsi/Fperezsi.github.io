This talk primarily focused on techniques to demonstrate the existence of solutions for nonlinear partial differential equations. Minimax theorems, such as the Mountain Pass Theorem and the Linking Theorem, were introduced. I also covered essential background techniques, including the Nemytskii Operator and the Deformation Lemma. The seminar lasted for two months.
