I am currently a Ph.D. student at George Mason University.
I hold a Bachelor's degree, an Engineering degree, and a Master's degree, all in Mathematics, from Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, where I completed my studies under the supervision of Dr. Leonelo Iturriaga.
My research focuses on nonlinear analysis of partial differential equations.
At present, I am expanding my expertise by studying the numerical analysis of partial differential equations under the supervision of Dr. Harbir Antil.

More specific details about my area of interest:
======
I am particularly interested in the study of existence and multiplicity of solutions obtained through min-max techniques, such as the Mountain Pass Theorem.
I also enjoy working with other methods, including fixed-point theorems and the method of sub- and super-solutions.
The operator I have studied most extensively is the p-Laplace operator, under both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.
